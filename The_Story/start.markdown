## The Story
Days felt like weeks, and weeks like years. She heard footsteps everywhere;<br>
and a distant voice saying: "Use the alternative port!".<br>
Everything around her spun and she couldn't see clearly.<br><br>

Alex was an invaluable asset to the Israeli Defense Forces. She was the most skilled, and the brightest cyber expert in Unit 8200 of the Israeli Army. Alex was kidnapped by the Iranian army, and they implanted a chip in her brain that's collecting classified information from her brain and disrupting her ability to think clearly and lucidly, as she had always been known to do.
After being rescued by the Israeli army, the chip was still implanted in her brain, hidden and locked so that it could not be deactivated. The lock was hidden deep in her brain, and so far no one had been able to unlock it.<br>
Ben, Alex's constant and quick-thinking partner, heard about his dear friend's condition and decided he was not willing to accept this situation.<br>
He would do anything to bring his dear partner back.<br>

He found a single .pyz file that's supposed to lead to his friend's rescue. Ben would do anything to bring her back.<br><br>
