**1337! The lock was released!**<br><br>

<br>
Ben released the lock. Alex's face changed, and suddenly she looked like herself again.<br>
A wide smile spread across both of their faces and they hugged.

The entire unit prepared a party to celebrate Alex's return.<br>
Her parents and closest friends were invited. The hall was filled with joy.<br>
A feeling of victory.

But,<br>
Ben and Alex knew that while they were celebrating, the Iranian army was growing stronger.<br>
Ben and Alex knew,<br>
that this;<br>
was not the end...<br><br>
